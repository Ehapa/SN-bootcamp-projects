# SN-bootcamp-projects

This is a repository of the solution to the mini project from ScholarNurture Bootcamp which  consists of three(3) machine learning models. It is a step by step mini project
Lending Club
Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Hopefully, as an investor you would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. A model is build to select among the many borrower who is likely to pay back and the model is use to predict.
Model: using a decision tree classifier and random forest classifier

Knn_project data
This is just a random used to get the possible nearest neighbors, forming loop and also calculating the distances between all the point.
Model: K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)

Advertising data
In this project consist on indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement. Then a  model is created that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.
Model: LogisticRegression
